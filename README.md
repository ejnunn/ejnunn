### Developer Skills

My coding experience spans backend development, distributed systems, and AI/ML research. I have designed and deployed solutions that improve system reliability and scalability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. 

#### Tools/Technologies
- **OS** : Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Languages** : Python, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries/Tools** : Docker, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch
- **Cloud Platforms** : AWS (S3, EC2, SQS, SNS, Cloudwatch, Cloudfront, DynamoDB, etc.)

### Personal Projects

#### Current Projects

1. **Advent of Code 2024**: Daily puzzles and brain-teasers testing your Data Structures & Algorithms knowledge, as well as other common software problem solving skills.  
2. **Bluesky Search Engine** (In Progress):  
   - **Scraper**: A completed web scraper that pulls posts from Bluesky by starting with a seed author and iteratively expanding to new authors referenced in posts.  
   - **TF-IDF Calculation**: Scripts are in place to compute TF-IDF scores for document-term pairs. Currently, this process works on a text file corpus and is being updated to process Bluesky posts directly.  
   - **Planned Features**: Future plans include adapting the TF-IDF pipeline for Bluesky data, adding a search frontend for users to query relevant authors by keyword, and deploying the project using Docker.  

#### Past Projects

1. **GAN Research**: Led a project to evaluate GAN output quality, proposing a novel metric. Results published in an [academic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08575).
